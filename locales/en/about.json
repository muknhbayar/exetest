  "Our world in this century is going through such instability that we have not experienced before. In the 20th Century, we witnessed the clash of imperialism against socialism, the cold war between US and USSR and the rise of Middle East countries’ influence backed by high oil prices. These tensions brought war and severe confrontations in the international scene, but on the other hand a certain stability was maintained with the power balance among the big countries. Since the birth of the 21st century, as a result of the changing power balance we are experiencing quite a new situation. The cycle of terrorism and local conflicts is recurring, and the ascendancy of emerging countries especially China is intensifying. Highly developed telecommunications networks have brought in the “Flat World”, and too much liquidity in the market is making the international financial system unstable and precipitating one financial crisis after another. Here in our country now, we have undergone a long economic slump after the bubble burst at the end of the last century, and Japan was transformed from a high economic growth country to a mature and low growth society. Aging and a low birth rate have brought about a decrease in population for the first time in this country’s history. Low consumption and fiscal imbalance have worsened and the low interest rate coupled with deflation are afflicting our economy. On top of that, the big March 2011 earthquake and the ensuing atomic accident have inflicted more burden on this country. I believe our country is now at the threshold of a new era and is calling for a big “change” from us. Unique Investments We, EXE were born on August 6th, 1991. Twenty years have passed since then, and as we were experiencing the turbulent last 10 years of the 20th century and the first 10 years of the 21st century, we have been constantly moving forward as a boutique investment house adapting to the change of air and the trend of the times. Change is Chance “Change is Chance” has been our guiding spirit through all this time. Our motto is not to shrink back from the changes of the times, but take to meet them head-on as business opportunities instead. We look carefully at what are needed in this society. We do not follow the fashion of “Now” but discern the trend of the “Future”. After making investments, we participate hands-on in the management of the companies and bring them up carefully like our children. That is the EXE investment style. Persistence to Human resource This investment motto is materialized in the domestic and Asian projects introduced here. We have realized and are managing several projects in Myanmar, Mongolia and Israel, thereby helping in these countries' development. This investment policy is applied to our approach to human resources. We take investment in people as most important and meaningful capital and are always looking for good people, people who look for the change by themselves, people who have their own ideas and policies. We welcome those ambitious young people who are aiming to run their own companies in the future by using EXE as their stepping board. In order to support those young people we also have an overseas internship program to allow them to experience actual business operations. I am pleased to introduce to you this unique investment house, EXE Corporation, and trust that you will accord us your continued interest and patronage.
